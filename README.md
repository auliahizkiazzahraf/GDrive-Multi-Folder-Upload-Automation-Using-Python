**Full automation helps reduce manual uploads from hours to seconds!**

This repo contains a simplified version of an automation I built at work to streamline monthly file uploads and permission management for each dealer's Google Drive folder.

⚠️ **Note**
This is a sanitized, public-safe version.  
No credentials or company data included.  

**🎯 Brief Concept**
Every month, I need to upload Excel files to the company’s Google Drive, into folders with a fairly deep structure:

Root Folder Name
│
├── Folder Area A
│   ├── Folder Kode Dealer
│   │   └── 2025
│   │       └── 10. kode dealer - Template 2025.xlsx
│   └── ...
│
├── Folder Area B
│   └── ...


Each dealer has their own folder, and inside it, there are year folders (2025, 2026, etc.).
I need to upload the template file to all dealer folders, automatically rename it according to the dealer code, and grant access to each dealer’s email.
Additionally, the system automatically consolidates all Google Drive links of uploaded files into a single Excel file.

**Scripts Overview**
1. upload_automation_sanitized.py
    Automates uploading Excel files to designated folders on Google Drive. Features include:
     - Copying a template file per dealer
     - Renaming files automatically
     - Uploading to the respective dealer folders
2. add_access_sanitized.py
    Automates adding access permissions to Google Drive folders or files.

Both scripts are self-contained and rely only on standard Python libraries and pydrive

**Features**
- Automatically uploads a single Excel template to 70+ dealer folders.
- Renames each file using the dealer code.
- Optionally grants access to different emails per dealer.

**Tech Stack**
- Python + Google Drive API
- JSON config for flexible structure
- OAuth2 user authorization

**🛠️ Quick setup**
    1. Enable Google Drive API in Google Cloud Console
    2. Download credentials.json (OAuth client ID)
    3. Create config.json and email_map.json
