# GDrive-Multi-Folder-Upload-Automation-Using-Python
Automates uploading files to multiple Google Drive folders and assigning different email access permissions for each folder using Python and Google Drive API.

**Context**  
This repo contains a simplified version of an automation I built at work to streamline monthly file uploads and permission management for each dealer's Google Drive folder.

**Features**
- Automatically uploads a single Excel template to 70+ dealer folders.
- Renames each file using the dealer code.
- Optionally grants access to different emails per dealer.
- Generates a rekap (summary) of file links for reporting.

**Tech Stack**
- Python + Google Drive API
- JSON config for flexible structure
- OAuth2 user authorization
