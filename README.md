This repo contains a simplified version of an automation I built at work to streamline monthly file uploads and permission management for each dealer's Google Drive folder.

**Scripts Overview**
1. upload_automation_sanitized.py
    Automates uploading Excel files to designated folders on Google Drive. Features include:
     - Copying a template file per dealer
     - Renaming files automatically
     - Uploading to the respective dealer folders
2. add_access_sanitized.py
    Automates adding access permissions to Google Drive folders or files.

Both scripts are self-contained and rely only on standard Python libraries and pydrive

**Features**
- Automatically uploads a single Excel template to 70+ dealer folders.
- Renames each file using the dealer code.
- Optionally grants access to different emails per dealer.

**Tech Stack**
- Python + Google Drive API
- JSON config for flexible structure
- OAuth2 user authorization

**Files**
